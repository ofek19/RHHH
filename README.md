Implementation of the ""Constant Time Updates in Hierarchical Heavy Hitters" paper, ACM SIGCOMM 2017

/******************************************************************************************************************************/

This is an open source implementation of the "Constant Time Updates in Hierarchical Heavy Hitters" paper,
published in ACM SIGCOMM 2017, by Ran Ben Basat, Gil Einziger, Roy Friedman, Marcelo Caggiani Luizelli, and Erez Waisbard.

Implementation was done by Ran Ben Basat (sran[at]cs.technion.ac.il), 2017.

I (Ofek Ben David) used Ran Ben Basat's implementation for the algorithms presented in the paper, and the scripts for running, analyzing and plotting the data, presented by Austin Poore and Tomy Fan from Stanford (https://github.com/lechengfan/RHHH) in order to reproduce figures 2-5 from the paper.
